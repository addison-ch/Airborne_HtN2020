# Airborne

Airborne is a web app designed to aid you in your travel decisions, so that you can make smart and safe commitments. Built with Flask and Dropbase API, Airborne provides you with relevant infectious disease information for whichever country you want to travel to. The current coronavirus pandemic has had a profound impact on our lives. We go about our days constantly scared, stressed, and maybe anxious about whether or not we will get sick. We worry about whether or not we might get our parents, friends, and family sick, but will this all end when the pandemic is over? Covid-19 has made everyone more aware of disease, viruses, and their own health. Airborne helps you to research countries and travel destinations where you will be safe.
