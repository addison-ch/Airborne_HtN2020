            <h3>What is it?</h3>
        </div>
        <div class='text'>Cholera is an acute diarrhoeal infection caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated
            with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Cholera remains a global threat to public health and an indicator of
            inequity and lack of social development. Researchers have estimated that every year, there are roughly 1.3
            to 4.0 million cases, and 21 000 to 143 000 deaths worldwide due to cholera. <a

                Organization)</a>

        <div class='desc'>
            <h3>Symptoms</h3>
        </div>
        <div class='text'>Cholera is an extremely virulent disease that can cause severe acute watery diarrhoea. It
            takes between 12 hours and 5 days for a person to show symptoms after ingesting contaminated food or water
            (2). Cholera affects both children and adults and can kill within hours if untreated.Most people infected
            with V. cholerae do not develop any symptoms, although the bacteria are present in their faeces for 1-10
            days after infection and are shed back into the environment, potentially infecting other people. Among
            people who develop symptoms, the majority have mild or moderate symptoms, while a minority develop acute
            watery diarrhoea with severe dehydration. This can lead to death if left untreated. <a

        <div class='desc'>
            <h3>Treatment</h3>
        </div>
        <div class='text'>Cholera is an easily treatable disease. The majority of people can be treated successfully
            through prompt administration of oral rehydration solution (ORS). The WHO/UNICEF ORS standard sachet is
            dissolved in 1 litre (L) of clean water. Adult patients may require up to 6 L of ORS to treat moderate
            dehydration on the first day. Rapid access to treatment is essential during a cholera outbreak. Oral
            rehydration should be available in communities, in addition to larger treatment centres that can provide
            intravenous fluids and 24 hour care. With early and proper treatment, the case fatality rate should remain
            below 1%. <a href="https://www.who.int/">(World Health Organization)</a></div>
        <div class='desc'>
            <h3>Prevention</h3>
        </div>
        <div class='text'>The long-term solution for cholera control lies in economic development and universal access
            to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation. Actions targeting environmental conditions include the
            implementation of adapted long-term sustainable WASH solutions to ensure use of safe water, basic sanitation
            and good hygiene practices in cholera hotspots. In addition to cholera, such interventions prevent a wide
            range of other water-borne illnesses, as well as contributing to achieving goals related to poverty,
            malnutrition, and education. <a href="https://www.who.int/">(World Health Organization)</a></div>
